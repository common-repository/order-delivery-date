Allow the customers to choose an order delivery date on the checkout page for WP e-Commerce store owners.

== Description ==

The customer experience after clicking the "BUY" button (often called as post-purchase experience) is as important as the acquisition process. That is why we built the **[Order Delivery Date plugin](https://www.tychesoftwares.com/store/premium-plugins/order-delivery-date-for-wp-e-commerce-pro/?utm_source=wprepo&utm_medium=topprolink&utm_campaign=WpecOrderDeliveryDateLite "Order Delivery Date plugin")**. It helps you to improve your customer service by delivering the orders on the customer’s specified date.

This plugin will allow the customer to choose an order delivery date on the checkout page. The customer can choose any delivery date that is after the current date. The plugin uses the inbuilt datepicker that comes with WordPress.

The delivery date chosen by the customer will be visible to the site administrator while viewing the order under the "Additional Checkout Fields" section.

Order Delivery Date settings in the Admin panel allow the site administrator to have control over aspects like setting the order delivery week days, minimum delivery time (in days) and number of dates to offer to the user to choose from.

This plugin allows you to improve your customer service by delivering the order on the customer's chosen date.
